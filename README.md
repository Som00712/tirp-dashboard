- **Scalable architecture** handling 100K+ survey responses

## 🚀 Quick Start

### **Prerequisites:**
- Neo4j Desktop or Neo4j Community Server
- Python 3.8+
- Power BI Desktop (optional)

### **Installation:**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Som00712/tirp-dashboard.git
cd tirp-dashboard

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up Neo4j database
neo4j start
# Import sample data
python scripts/import_data.py --data_path data/sample_survey.csv

# Run the dashboard
python app.py
```

### **Access the Application:**
- **Dashboard:** http://localhost:8050
- **Neo4j Browser:** http://localhost:7474
- **API Endpoints:** http://localhost:8050/api/

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### **Core Components:**

1. **Data Ingestion Pipeline** - Automated CSV to graph conversion
2. **Neo4j Graph Store** - Relationship-focused data storage
3. **Analytics Engine** - Python-based computation layer
4. **Dashboard Interface** - Interactive web application
5. **Reporting Layer** - Power BI integration for presentations

## 📁 Data Model

### **Graph Schema:**
```cypher
# Survey participants as nodes
(:Respondent {id, age, gender, location, education})

# Survey questions as nodes  
(:Question {id, text, category, type})

# Responses as relationships
(:Respondent)-[:ANSWERED {value, timestamp}]->(:Question)

# Demographic relationships
(:Respondent)-[:LIVES_IN]->(:Location)
(:Respondent)-[:WORKS_IN]->(:Industry)
```

### **Key Relationships:**
- **Response patterns** between participants and questions
- **Demographic correlations** across different groups  
- **Temporal trends** in survey completion
- **Geographic distributions** of responses

## 🔧 Core Features

### **1. Interactive Graph Visualization**
```python
# Network analysis of survey relationships
import networkx as nx
from py2neo import Graph

# Connect to Neo4j
graph = Graph("bolt://localhost:7687", auth=("neo4j", "password"))

# Query participant relationships
query = """
MATCH (r1:Respondent)-[:ANSWERED]->(q:Question)<-[:ANSWERED]-(r2:Respondent)
WHERE r1.age_group = r2.age_group
RETURN r1, r2, count(q) as shared_questions
"""

# Visualize in dashboard
results = graph.run(query)
```

### **2. Real-time Analytics Dashboard**
- **Response completion rates** by demographic
- **Question difficulty analysis** based on skip patterns
- **Correlation heatmaps** between survey variables
- **Geographic response mapping** with filters

### **3. Advanced Query Interface**
```cypher
-- Find respondents with similar response patterns
MATCH (r1:Respondent)-[:ANSWERED {value: v}]->(q:Question)
MATCH (r2:Respondent)-[:ANSWERED {value: v}]->(q)
WHERE r1 <> r2
WITH r1, r2, count(q) as similarity
WHERE similarity > 5
RETURN r1.id, r2.id, similarity
ORDER BY similarity DESC
```

## 📊 Dashboard Components

### **Main Analytics View:**
- **Response Overview** - Total responses, completion rates
- **Demographic Breakdown** - Age, gender, location distributions  
- **Question Analysis** - Most/least answered questions
- **Relationship Explorer** - Interactive graph visualization

### **Power BI Integration:**
```python
# Export data for Power BI reports
def export_for_powerbi():
    query = """
    MATCH (r:Respondent)-[a:ANSWERED]->(q:Question)
    RETURN r.id as respondent_id,
           r.age as age,
           r.gender as gender,
           q.id as question_id,
           q.category as question_category,
           a.value as response_value
    """
    data = graph.run(query).to_data_frame()
    data.to_csv('data/powerbi_export.csv', index=False)
```

## 🔍 Query Examples

### **Find Response Patterns:**
```cypher
// Identify questions with low completion rates
MATCH (q:Question)
OPTIONAL MATCH (q)<-[:ANSWERED]-(r:Respondent)
WITH q, count(r) as responses
MATCH (total:Respondent)
WITH q, responses, count(total) as total_respondents
RETURN q.text, 
       responses, 
       total_respondents,
       round(100.0 * responses / total_respondents, 2) as completion_rate
ORDER BY completion_rate ASC
```

## 🚀 API Endpoints

```python
# RESTful API for external integrations
@app.route('/api/responses/<respondent_id>')
def get_respondent_data(respondent_id):
    """Get all responses for a specific respondent"""
    
@app.route('/api/questions/<category>')  
def get_questions_by_category(category):
    """Get questions filtered by category"""
    
@app.route('/api/analytics/completion-rates')
def get_completion_rates():
    """Get completion rates by question and demographic"""
```

## 📈 Performance Optimizations

### **Database Optimizations:**
```cypher
// Create indexes for faster queries
CREATE INDEX respondent_id FOR (r:Respondent) ON (r.id);
CREATE INDEX question_category FOR (q:Question) ON (q.category);
CREATE INDEX response_timestamp FOR ()-[a:ANSWERED]-() ON (a.timestamp);
```

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run unit tests
pytest tests/unit/

# Integration tests with Neo4j
pytest tests/integration/

# Dashboard functionality tests
